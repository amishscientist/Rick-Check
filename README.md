# Rick-Check
It's a tool to help you test you projects trick dependency(This is very much a progress in work.  If you run it you will know why it is a progress in work vs a work in progress).

In theory you would build your sim, run your runs and then run rick check with your trick home where the sim is located and a config file. 
I have a small make example script, but it's still pretty rough.
